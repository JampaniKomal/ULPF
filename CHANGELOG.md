# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. Semantic Versioning applies from the first
tagged release; until then everything lives under Unreleased.

Figures quoted here are reproducible from the repository — see
[docs/DATASETS.md](docs/DATASETS.md) for coverage and
[docs/THROUGHPUT.md](docs/THROUGHPUT.md) for ingest rate.

## [Unreleased]

### Ingest and preservation

- Append-only zstd raw vault: byte-exact, CRC-verified, indexed retrieval by
  locator. The vault append happens **before** parsing, so a record ULPF cannot
  interpret is still preserved and still addressable.
- File, stdin and UDP syslog ingestion. The receiver enlarges its socket buffer
  at bind; the OS default drops 37% of datagrams at 15,000 events/sec.

### Normalization

- OCSF 1.9.0 output, schema vendored at `schema/ocsf` as an unmodified upstream
  snapshot.
- Ten decoders: RFC 3164 and RFC 5424 syslog, CEF, LEEF, JSON, XML, CSV,
  key-value, and regex.
- Thirty-five declarative Source Packs, 78 fixtures, 100% field accuracy.
- Coverage measured over real perimeter capture data with the misses
  enumerated rather than rounded away. Reproduce the current figure with
  `python tools/measure_coverage.py --set perimeter`; corpora outside the
  perimeter scope are measured separately and never blended into it.
- Salvage extraction: addresses, ports, MAC addresses, URLs, email addresses
  and hostnames recovered from any record, including one no pack claimed, so a
  source nobody has onboarded is still searchable by indicator. Deterministic,
  and it populates `observables` only — it reports that an address is present,
  never that it is the source.

### Fixed

- **The Merkle root was rebuilt from every leaf on every checkpoint.** `run`
  checkpoints every 8,192 events, so a run cost `(n / 8192) * O(n)` hashes --
  quadratic in the record count, in a framework whose target is billions of
  events per day. Invisible on small corpora and crippling on large ones:
  22,421 events/sec over 40,000 records against 2,460 over 8.1 million. The log
  now maintains the perfect-subtree roots that tile its leaves, so an append is
  amortised O(1) and the root is a fold. Same corpus after: 13,290 events/sec,
  byte-identical output.
- **Adding a Source Pack did not hot-reload**, which is exactly what console
  approval does -- an approved pack silently never activated. A file being
  written emits several events, the debounce discarded all but the first, and
  that first one read a half-written file. The watcher now coalesces and
  reloads once the directory is quiet.
- **Four perimeter corpora were measured on 2,000-line samples** while the
  complete corpora sat unfetched in the same Zenodo deposit: Apache, Linux,
  Proxifier and OpenSSH. The fetcher declared twelve of the deposit's nineteen
  archives; it now declares all of them, with no tiering.
- **A truncated download was renamed as though complete**, failed at
  extraction as "not a gzip file", and could never recover because the bad
  archive was kept and skipped on the next run. Transfers are now checked
  against `Content-Length` and unreadable archives are discarded.
- **Measurement scratch was written to the system temp directory**, on the OS
  volume. Large corpora filled it, their runs died, and a dead run was then
  reported as *absent* rather than failed.

### Integrity

- Per-event content fingerprint over RFC 8785 canonical JSON, chained to its
  predecessor, with Ed25519-signed checkpoints.
- RFC 6962 Merkle log over event fingerprints, signed into every checkpoint.
- `ulpf prove` / `ulpf verify-proof`: prove one record belongs to the log in
  `O(log n)` hashes, verifiable by someone holding no other part of it.
- `ulpf consistency`: bridge a proof issued against an older tree to the
  current signed root, which is what shows the log was extended and not
  rewritten.

### Output

- NDJSON by default; dead-letter stream for unparsed records.
- Parquet archive of whole OCSF documents, OpenSearch Bulk and Splunk HEC
  fan-out, all batched.
- `--forward-udp`: each normalized event as one OCSF datagram, for standing
  ULPF in front of a SIEM that already listens on syslog. Best-effort by
  nature, and it reports what it sent, failed and skipped.
- Columnar feature table with a fixed, versioned 24-column contract for model
  training, distinct from the document archive.

### Operations

- Embedded operator console, compiled into the binary: no CDN, no web font, no
  telemetry, no network call on any path.
- Pack drafting from unparsed traffic — a deterministic generator, and an
  optional local model — with fixture gates before activation. Drafted packs
  infer their decoder chain and delimiter from the samples and map fields by
  naming convention, so a candidate for a perimeter source arrives with
  `src_endpoint`, `dst_endpoint` and `connection_info` already populated.
- Sharded deployment: `ulpf verify` partitions a merged stream by `chain_uid`
  and checks each collector's chain against its own key, so a multi-collector
  deployment verifies without merging its chains.
- Two-stage container onto distroless with a read-only root filesystem and all
  capabilities dropped, plus a three-shard compose file for the horizontal
  deployment.
- Graceful shutdown on Ctrl-C and SIGTERM: signs a final checkpoint and closes
  the Parquet writers, without which the feature table is never readable.

### Correctness fixes worth naming

These shipped broken and were found by running the system rather than by
testing it, which is why they are listed:

- Apache and Squid numbered HTTP methods in the order they were written down
  rather than the order OCSF defines, recording every `GET` as `Connect` and
  every `POST` as `Delete`. Both packs passed every fixture for weeks.
  `tools/audit_pack_enums.py` now checks every pack against the vendored schema
  in CI.
- A non-ASCII byte inside an XML element killed the collector — a slice on a
  character boundary. Now a byte comparison, with a hostile-input test suite.
- `/api/approve` joined an operator-supplied pack id onto a path, and
  `Path::join` discards the base entirely when handed an absolute path, so a
  pack could be written anywhere on the filesystem.
- The console reported a healthy chain as broken about forty seconds into any
  demonstration, when the 501st event evicted the record its successor pointed
  at.
- Parquet partitioning wrote every row to `dt=1970-01-01` — nanoseconds read as
  milliseconds.

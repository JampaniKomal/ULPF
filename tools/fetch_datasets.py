"""Download the public log corpora ULPF's coverage claims are measured on.

Nothing here is generated. Every file comes from a public research dataset and
is used byte-for-byte as published, so the figures in docs/DATASETS.md can be
reproduced independently.

    python tools/fetch_datasets.py                  # the measured set, ~5.6 GB
    python tools/fetch_datasets.py --dir D:/corpora # somewhere with room
    python tools/fetch_datasets.py --all            # + 86 GB of unmeasured corpora
    python tools/fetch_datasets.py --only Apache    # resume one corpus

**The default is exactly the corpora the published figure is measured on** --
the thirteen in `PERIMETER` in tools/measure_coverage.py, plus the 2,000-line
Loghub samples and the SotM30 cross-validation capture. Roughly 5.6 GB. After
this, `python tools/measure_coverage.py` reproduces the headline table in about
forty minutes on an ordinary laptop.

The default must stay tied to what the published table needs. An earlier
version defaulted to a ~200 MB "standard" tier while the full corpora for four
perimeter sources (Apache, Linux, Proxifier, OpenSSH) sat unfetched in the same
Zenodo deposit -- so the command in the README produced a corpus set the
published table could not be measured on. Fetching *everything* fixed that and
introduced the opposite problem: 92 GB and ten hours of pipeline time, 86 GB of
which no published figure uses. Both failures are the same mistake, which is
letting the download set drift away from the measured set.

`--all` adds the fifteen corpora outside the Current Scope sentence. They are
genuinely interesting -- Thunderbird is 211 million records -- but nothing this
project claims is measured on them, and they are not needed to check any of it.

Every completed file is skipped on a rerun and every partial transfer resumes
with an HTTP Range request, so an interrupted fetch is restarted by running
the same command again.

Nothing here is generated. Every file comes from a public research dataset and
is used byte-for-byte as published.

#     (`README.md` sits in the same archive and was already excluded, because
#     `.md` is not in the filter — which is why only this one got through.)
#   * `OpenStack.tar.gz` — six lines naming the VM instances with injected
#     anomalies. Worse than the line count: its final line has no terminator,
#     so it fused onto the first real record and produced
#     `1643649d-...nova-api.log.2017-05-14_21:27:04 ...` — one genuine log
#     record destroyed, silently.
#
# Neither corpus is in the perimeter set, so neither moved the headline
# coverage figure. They still have no business in a file this project calls
# unmodified capture data: a reviewer comparing a record count against Loghub's
# published one finds a discrepancy we cannot explain, and every line of it is
# junk the pipeline is then scored on. Excluding the label file is also the
# scientifically correct choice — it is the answer key, not the exam.

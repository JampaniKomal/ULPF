# PERIMETER is the set the headline coverage figure is measured on, and it is
# the set the problem statement's Current Scope sentence describes. It is
# reported on its own so that adding a non-perimeter source can never quietly
# move the number that answers the statement.
#
# Each entry names the files that can satisfy it, best first. The complete
# corpus is always preferred; the 2,000-line Loghub sample is a fallback so a
# machine part-way through a fetch still produces a table, and the report says
# which one was actually measured.
#
# Measuring the sample when the full corpus exists is how a coverage figure
# quietly becomes meaningless: four of the perimeter sources below were scored
# on 2,000 lines each for exactly that reason, while the complete corpora sat
# in the same Zenodo deposit unfetched.

# Security policy

## Supported branch

Security fixes are applied to `main` while ULPF is pre-1.0. Tagged releases may be replaced rather than maintained as parallel branches.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability. Report it privately through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting (the repository's Security tab, then Report a vulnerability). If that option is not shown, open an issue that asks for a private contact and contains no details. Include the affected commit, impact, reproduction, and any proposed mitigation. Do not include real credentials or sensitive operational logs.

The maintainer will acknowledge a complete report within three working days and provide status within seven working days.

## Deployment guidance

- The console requires a bearer token on every `/api/*` route by default,
  generated on first `serve`, stored at `<integrity-dir>/console.token` with
  owner-only file permissions, and printed once at startup. It also refuses
  cross-origin requests and requests carrying an unexpected `Host`, which
  stops a page the operator has open in another tab from driving it (CSRF)
  and stops a hostile name resolving to loopback (DNS rebinding); this second
  check is browser-safety, kept as defense in depth alongside the token, not
  instead of it. `--no-auth` disables the token check for a throwaway local
  demo — with it set, the browser-safety guard is the *only* remaining
  control, and anyone who can reach the port directly can still write a
  Source Pack, which decides how every subsequent record is interpreted. Bind
  to `127.0.0.1` (the default) unless the deployment genuinely needs a wider
  interface, and place a real reverse proxy in front for anything beyond a
  trusted local/lab network regardless.
- Plain HTTP is the console's default. `--tls-self-signed` (a cached,
  self-signed certificate generated on first run) or `--tls-cert`/`--tls-key`
  (an operator-supplied certificate) terminate HTTPS instead. Use one of these
  whenever `--host` binds beyond loopback — otherwise the console token and
  every raw log byte `/api/raw/{locator}` returns cross the network in the
  clear.
- `/healthz` and `/readyz` are deliberately outside both the token and the
  Origin/Host guard so an orchestrator can probe them without a secret.
  Neither discloses event data; `/readyz` reports only pack count, vault
  writability and schema version.
- Treat `data/integrity/ed25519-signing.key` and `data/integrity/console.token`
  as secrets of the same class: whoever reads the signing key can forge a
  checkpoint, and whoever reads the token can act as the console operator.
  Both are excluded from Git and created with owner-only permissions; back
  them up through the team's secret-management process, not by copying them
  into a less-restricted location.
- Both the signing key and the vault can be encrypted at rest, each with its
  own flag, and both are **opt-in, not the default** — without them, the key
  is hex on disk and the vault's block payloads are plain zstd frames,
  protected only by the owner-only permission the loose-permission check
  enforces on the key at every load (the vault directory has no equivalent
  check; ordinary filesystem permissions are all that guard it unencrypted).
  `--encrypt-key` wraps a newly created signing key in a ChaCha20-Poly1305
  envelope keyed by an Argon2id-derived passphrase (`ULPF_KEY_PASSPHRASE`, or
  a hidden-input prompt). `--encrypt-vault` does the same for every block
  payload, keyed by an independent passphrase (`ULPF_VAULT_PASSPHRASE`) and
  a per-vault-directory salt (`vault.salt`, not itself secret — only stable
  across reopens, so a passphrase always re-derives the same key). Use one,
  both, or neither, depending on which secret an operator wants to manage.
  A wrong passphrase and a corrupted file are refused with the identical
  error on purpose, for both — an AEAD decrypt failure gives an attacker no
  way to distinguish "you guessed wrong" from "the file is damaged." Losing
  either passphrase means losing that secret exactly as if the file itself
  were destroyed; there is no recovery path, so treat both as carefully as
  the plaintext they replace. Reading an existing key or vault
  auto-detects its format regardless of the current run's flags — a vault
  that had encryption turned on partway through its life is read correctly
  either way, since each segment declares its own encryption state in its
  header rather than trusting external configuration.
- Pin a trusted public key out of band when verifying checkpoints; a
  checkpoint's `verify_self_signed()` proves internal consistency, not that
  the embedded key is who you think it is.
- Do not run the UDP listener on an untrusted interface without network controls and capacity limits appropriate to the deployment.
- Keep raw vaults and normalized output under the same data-classification controls as the original logs.
- Do not commit datasets containing personal, organizational, or operational telemetry.

## Cryptographic scope

The event chain detects modification, deletion, insertion, and reordering inside a stream. Authenticity comes from the persisted Ed25519 checkpoint and a trusted public key. A self-signed checkpoint checked only against its embedded key proves consistency, not identity.
